<h1>Dysphonia analysis for predicting Parkinson's disease.</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This project analyzes vocal measurement data from the Parkinsons's dataset in UCI Machine Learning. Using the datset of various vocal features, we perform:
    <ul>
        <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
        <li>Feature Correlation Analysis</li>
        <li>Classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest</li>
    </ul>
        The dataset comprises of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and about six measurements for each patient. The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column (0 for healthy and 1 for PD). There are a total of 197 instances for 22 features.

<h3>EDA</h3>
  <p>Final analysis committing soon.</p>
<h3>Classification</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li>RobustScaler was used instead of StandardScaler due to some features containing high number of outliers. Consequently, using RobustScaler made such that spread1 and PPE were the two most important features for classification.</li>
